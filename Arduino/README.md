This is a directory of my simple arduino projects. I will be constantly uploading new projects over time.
1. ***LCD***
This is a simple arduino LCD that prints what you tell it to. Used the LiquidCrystal library that is not difficult to implement. Main functions are:
```lcd.begin()```
```lcd.autoScroll()```
```lcd.leftToRight()```
```lcd.scrollDisplayLeft()```
```lcd.blink()```
```lcd.print()```
```lcd.setCursor()```
```lcd.clear()```
```lcd.begin()```
2. ***ParticleConcentrationLCD***
This is a simple arduino project that uses an LCD, an LED and an LDR to sense the percentage of particle concentration in the environment. This LED will emit light and as the light deflects off the surface of the particles it becomes scattered and the LDR will sense the amount of light that is able to reach it. The LCD will show the percentage of particle concentration in the environment. 
3. ***RGB LED***
This is a beginner arduino project that only requires an RGB LED and a resistor to work. The RGB LED is a special type of LED that has 4 nodes: 
> * Anode
> * Red 
> * Green
> * Blue
